/*"1. Design a class for a simple database connection pool. The class should have the following features:
        - A private constructor to prevent the class from being instantiated directly.
        - A static method that returns an instance of the class (following the singleton pattern).
        - A method that returns a new connection to the database.
        - A method that closes all open connections and releases them back to the pool.
        2. Design a class for a basic point in 2D space. The class should have the following features:
        - Instance variables for the x and y coordinates of the point.
        - A constructor that allows the user to create a point with given x and y coordinates.
        - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a point with the same x and y coordinates, and false otherwise.
        - A clone method that creates and returns a new point with the same x and y coordinates as the original point.
        3. Design a class for a basic credit card. The class should have the following features:
        - Instance variables for the cardholder's name, card number, and expiration date.
        - A constructor that allows the user to create a credit card with a given name, card number, and expiration date.
        - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a credit card with the same card number, and false otherwise.
        - A clone method that creates and returns a new credit card with the same name, card number, and expiration date as the original credit card."*/
